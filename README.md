# Java-SQL-Projects

This repository started with 'Zoo', my graduation project for a 6-month course on webdesign with object-oriented languages and relational databases.
I started on 'Library' a few months later to keep everything fresh in my mind. This project petered out somewhat because while I tried to keep on writing everything from scratch, in the end I couldn't escape the fact that it was a clone of the 'Zoo' project.

The 'Test' folder is a piece of project I use sometimes to separate out pieces of code and see if they work (or make them work) separately before re-adding them to a larger project.

The Winter Fair project is different: the idea was to make a SQL-and-JavaScript-powered interactive story in the web browser. The bits of the story are retrieved from the database based on the reader's choices.
The basic system to make this work functions correctly, which sapped the project of a large part of the challenge, and after writing some more of the story options, I moved on to different projects.
